## Features
- Load and clean raw sales data from a CSV file
- Analyze revenue by product and by time (monthly trends)
- Generate visualizations for key metrics

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd sales-data-analysis
```

3. Place your raw sales data file (`sales_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

4. Run the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

5. View the output visualizations and metrics generated.

## Example Dataset
The example `sales_data.csv` file contains the following columns:
- **Order Date**: The date of the order (e.g., `2023-01-15`)
- **Sales**: The total revenue generated by the order (e.g., `250.50`)
- **Product**: The product sold (e.g., `Laptop`)

## Results
The script generates:
- Total revenue metrics
- Revenue by product category
- Monthly revenue trends
- Bar charts and line graphs to visualize these insights
